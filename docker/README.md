# Docker ðŸŽ¡

Project used to test docker in a simple express server, to learn more about imagem, container, volumes and more about docker.

## Running project

To the step below work is necessary that all developer environment be correctly configured.

My OS: Windows 11

To configure I was using git bash terminal.

Use **npm** to install the dependencies of the project in bash terminal.

Step 1:

```cl
npm i
```

Step 2:

```cl
npm run start
```

Here, you can see in http://localhost:3333 server is alive.

Now, stop step 2 and go to bash terminal to run build.sh

Step 3:

```cl
sh ./build.sh
```

Then, the image and container will be create.

So, try again to get http://localhost:3333, to see server is alive again, but running inside container docker.
